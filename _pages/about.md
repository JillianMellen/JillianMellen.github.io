My name is Jillian Mellen. I'm a master's student in physics, a physics education researcher, teacher, and mom of two.

I've investigated student self-efficacy in a flipped classroom, and am using natural language processing to see if there is a link between the sentiment of participant text responses and their answers to survey questions about teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.
